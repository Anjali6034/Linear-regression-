# 📊 Simple Linear Regression

This notebook demonstrates the use of **Simple Linear Regression** to model the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable. The goal is to predict the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Understand the relationship between two variables.
- Build a regression model using **scikit-learn**.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like **R²** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Visualize the data and the regression line.

## 🔍 Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loading and cleaning the dataset.
   - Identifying missing values and handling them.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing the data through scatter plots and correlation analysis.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Training a simple linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
  
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Calculating R² and MSE to measure model performance.

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plotting the regression line on the scatter plot.

### 📦 Libraries Used

- `Pandas`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `Scikit-learn`

### 📁 Files Included

- `regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for simple linear regression analysis.
- `data.csv`: Dataset used for building the regression model.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- Visual representation of the linear relationship between variables.
- Insight into how the independent variable influences the dependent variable.
- A basic linear regression model that can predict future values based on the data.
